# Android Notes

## Fragments

> A Fragment in Android development is a part of an activity which represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an activity. It is used to represent part of UI of an activity which can be added or replaced dynamically. Fragments are used to build flexible and dynamic user interfaces.

## Adapters

> In Android development, an adapter is a bridge between an app's data and the View objects that display the data. It is used to adapt data from a data source, such as an array or a database, to be displayed in a View, such as a ListView or a GridView.

## Intents

> In Android development, an Intent is a message object that is used to request an action from another component, such as an Activity, a Service, or a Broadcast Receiver. Intents are used to start new activities, to start a service, to deliver a broadcast, and to start other components.

## Recycler View Adapter

> A RecyclerView Adapter in Android development is a component that binds data to a RecyclerView. It is responsible for creating the views for each item in the data set and also for replacing the content of views when the data set changes. The RecyclerView Adapter is similar to a ListView Adapter, but with more flexibility and performance improvements. It uses a ViewHolder pattern to optimize the performance of the RecyclerView by recycling the views and avoiding unnecessary view creations.

## Layout Inflater

> A LayoutInflater in Android development is a class that is used to instantiate layout XML files into their corresponding View objects. It is used to create the user interface of an activity or a fragment by inflating the layout file into a ViewGroup.

## Intent Filter

> In Android development, an Intent Filter is a mechanism used to register an activity, service, or broadcast receiver in the Android system so that it can respond to specific events or intents.
